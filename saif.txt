I love my Country.
I love myself.
I fixed myself.
Myself is giving company my.
I tighted my nafs and trained to be disciplined one!
I won I vs I.
Working as i Planned and Fixed the way of learning.
I forgave for my all old sins that i have done with my own.
Tricking the mind to do What have to do and have planned. 
Just be calm and clear and Get into it!
Just Do it!
Don't hurry, Just calm in your mind!
I am average and i know my worth.
If i do work with Fully focused mind, then i will be average. But If i want to change the Game then i have to just consistent with my Task and doing or executing plan is enough, though it will take sometime more than my thinking but Result would be more Long lasting and reliable at all.
Allah is The Best Planner.
Allah Please do kabul me for Akhirah and Duniiya.
